The **inhibit-mouse** package allows the disabling of mouse input in Emacs using `inhibit-mouse-mode`.

Instead of modifying the keymap of its own mode as the *disable-mouse* package does, enabling inhibit-mouse-mode only modifies input-decode-map to disable mouse events, making it more efficient and faster than *disable-mouse*.

Additionally, the *inhibit-mouse* package allows for the restoration of mouse input when `inhibit-mouse-mode` is disabled.

## Installation

To install `outline-indent` from MELPA:

1. If you haven't already done so, [add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started).
2. Add the following code to the Emacs init file:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package inhibit-mouse
  :ensure t
  :config
  (inhibit-mouse-mode 1))
```

## Customization

### Preventing help from being displayed when hovering over items?

To prevent help from being displayed when hovering over items (e.g., tooltips):

```elisp
;; Disable help display when hovering over items
(setq show-help-function nil)
```

### Customizing the mouse buttons disabled by inhibit-mouse?

The *inhibit-mouse* custom variables allow you to fine-tune which mouse interactions are disabled.

You can use the following configuration to specify which mouse buttons and events you want to disable:
``` emacs-lisp
;; This variable specifies which mouse buttons should be inhibited from
;; triggering events.
(setq inhibit-mouse-button-numbers '(1 2 3 4 5))

;; List of mouse button events to be inhibited.
(setq inhibit-mouse-button-events '("mouse"
                                    "up-mouse"
                                    "down-mouse"
                                    "drag-mouse"))

;; List of miscellaneous mouse events to be inhibited.
(setq inhibit-mouse-misc-events '("wheel-up"
                                  "wheel-down"
                                  "wheel-left"
                                  "wheel-right"
                                  "pinch"))

;; List of mouse multiplier events to be inhibited.
(setq inhibit-mouse-multipliers '("double" "triple"))

;; List of key modifier combinations to be inhibited for mouse events.
(setq inhibit-mouse-key-modifiers '((control)
                                    (meta)
                                    (shift)
                                    (control meta shift)
                                    (control meta)
                                    (control shift)
                                    (meta shift)))
```

### Disabling mouse highlighting over clickable text (e.g., URLs, hyperlinks, etc.)

The `inhibit-mouse-adjust-mouse-highlight` variable controls whether clickable text, such as URLs or hyperlinks, is highlighted when the mouse hovers over them. By default, it is set to t (enabled), but you can disable it by setting the variable to nil.

Default value:
``` emacs-lisp
(setq inhibit-mouse-adjust-mouse-highlight t)
```

### Enabling/Disabling the context menu

To enable or disable the context menu based on the state of `inhibit-mouse-mode`, the following code dynamically toggles `context-menu-mode` accordingly:

```elisp
(add-hook 'inhibit-mouse-mode-hook
          #'(lambda()
              ;; Enable or disable the context menu based on the state of
              ;; `inhibit-mouse-mode', the following code dynamically toggles
              ;; `context-menu-mode' accordingly.
              (when (fboundp 'context-menu-mode)
                (if (bound-and-true-p inhibit-mouse-mode)
                    (context-menu-mode -1)
                  (context-menu-mode 1)))))
```

This ensures that the context menu is disabled when `inhibit-mouse-mode` is active and enabled when it is inactive.

## Frequently Asked Question
### What motivates the author to disable the mouse in Emacs?

The author disables the mouse in Emacs:
- To prevent accidental clicks or cursor movements that can change the cursor position unexpectedly.
- To reinforce a keyboard-centric workflow, helping to avoid the habit of relying on the mouse for navigation.

Some may suggest that the author could modify the touchpad settings at the OS level. However, he prefers not to disable the touchpad entirely, as it remains useful in other applications, such as web browsers.

### What is the difference between the disable-mouse and inhibit-mouse packages?

The *inhibit-mouse* package is a efficient alternative to the *disable-mouse* package, as it only modifies *input-decode-map* to disable mouse events.

In contrast, *disable-mouse* applies mouse events to its own mode, and sometimes the user has to apply it to other modes that are not affected by the *disable-mouse* mode using the `disable-mouse-in-keymap` function (e.g, evil-mode, tab-bar...).

Additionally, *inhibit-mouse*:
- Allows re-enabling mouse functionality when the mode is disabled, which is not supported by *disable-mouse* when the `disable-mouse-in-keymap` function is used. The `disable-mouse-in-keymap` function overwrites the key mappings of other modes (e.g., evil, tab-bar), and there is no straightforward way to make *disable-mouse* restore them.
- It resolves issues that *disable-mouse* does not, such as the "C-c C-x <mouse-wheel-down> is not bound" problem, where the user intended to enter C-c C-x j but accidentally touched the touchpad.

This concept of utilizing `input-decode-map` to disable the mouse was introduced by Stefan Monnier in an emacs-devel mailing list [thread](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-11/msg00013.html) initiated by Daniel Radetsky, who proposed a patch to the Emacs developers. Additionally, here is an interesting discussion on GitHub: [Add recipe for inhibit-mouse](https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/9229).
