The **inhibit-mouse** package allows the disabling of mouse input in Emacs using `inhibit-mouse-mode`.

Instead of modifying the keymap of its own mode as the disable-mouse package does, enabling inhibit-mouse-mode only modifies input-decode-map to disable mouse events, making it more efficient and faster than disable-mouse.

Additionally, the *inhibit-mouse* package allows for the restoration of mouse input when `inhibit-mouse-mode` is disabled.

This concept of utilizing `input-decode-map` to disable the mouse was introduced by Stefan Monnier in an emacs-devel mailing list [thread](https://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/emacs-devel/2024-11/msg00013.html) initiated by Daniel Radetsky, who proposed a patch to the Emacs developers.

## Installation

To install `outline-indent` from MELPA:

1. If you haven't already done so, [add MELPA repository to your Emacs configuration](https://melpa.org/#/getting-started).
2. Add the following code to the Emacs init file:
```emacs-lisp
(use-package inhibit-mouse
  :ensure t
  :config
  (inhibit-mouse-mode))
```

# Frequently Asked Question

### What is the difference between the disable-mouse and inhibit-mouse packages?

The *inhibit-mouse* package is a simpler and faster alternative to the *disable-mouse* package, as it only modifies *input-decode-map* to disable mouse events.

In contrast, *disable-mouse* applies mouse events to its own mode, and sometimes the user has to apply it to other modes that are not affected by the *disable-mouse* mode using the `disable-mouse-in-keymap` function (e.g, evil-mode, tab-bar...).

Additionally, *inhibit-mouse* allows re-enabling mouse functionality when the mode is disabled, which is not supported by *disable-mouse* when the `disable-mouse-in-keymap` function is used. The `disable-mouse-in-keymap` function overwrites the key mappings of other modes (e.g., evil, tab-bar), and there is no straightforward way to make `disable-mouse` restore them.

### Is there an alternative package that utilizes input-decode-map?

Daniel Radetsky, the person who sent an email to emacs-devel about disabling the mouse, developed a [similar package](https://github.com/dradetsky/ignore-mouse) that deactivates the mouse using `input-decode-map`. Coincidentally, we had the same idea at about the same time after reading Stefan Monnier's email.

### What motivates the author to disable the mouse in Emacs?

The author disables the mouse in Emacs:
- To prevent accidental clicks or cursor movements that can change the cursor position unexpectedly.
- To reinforce a keyboard-centric workflow, helping to avoid the habit of relying on the mouse for navigation.

Some may suggest that the author could modify the touchpad settings at the OS level. However, he prefers not to disable the touchpad entirely, as it remains useful in other applications, such as web browsers.
